## üìå What is Docker Compose?

**Docker Compose** is a powerful tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It simplifies the deployment of complex service stacks into a single command, streamlining development workflows.

##  Why Use Docker Compose? 

Imagine your app needs:

- A **web server**
- A **database**
- **etc...**

Without Docker Compose, you'd have to start each container manually ‚Äî and remember how to connect them, set ports, link volumes, etc.

### üõ†Ô∏è Docker Compose helps by:

1) Starting everything with just **one command**  
2) Making sure containers can **talk to each other**  
3) Keeping setup in **one easy-to-read file**  
4) Making it easy to **share or restart** your setup
